                            <p>Есть такая смешная история про студентов, спросивших своего бородатого профессора, как он спит со своей бородой – кладёт ли он её на одеяло или под одеяло.  SCENARIO: Atlantic Rim MechaGodzilla (Kiryu) is sent by Japan to investigate a possible Godzilla sighting near the east coast of North America. On the way, MechaGodzilla malfunctions like in the movie and begins terrorizing Maine. The US government, not knowing what they're up against, promptly deploys Gipsy Danger, the only Jaeger within a 2000 kilometre radius in order to minimize damage. Meanwhile, Team Dai-Gurren (Gurren Lagann) spots Gipsy Danger about. So, I don't know what the opinions will be on this, but just to clarify - I do this just for myself, on an offline 360 that can't be used on Live, I have all Forza LCE's bought, so don't go calling me a pirate or hacker and so on, please :) Anyway, here's an album with a few images, just to show you some of the things you can do: Lower the car as much as you want, increase the wheel offset, change the rim size options to anything you like (both width and height) see title, the pics on Cinelli's website look pretty tight at the rear with a 23mm. http://www.cinelli.it/site/index.php/prodotti?page=shop.product_detailsampflypage=cinelliflypage.tplampproduct_id=137ampcategory_id=1ampsub=3amplang=en.

Harsh but fair pockets of civilization out on the Rim. Prisoners do hard labor for a few years as restitution for any damage done. Nothing horrible, just rolling smokeleaf, working in the quarry or greenhouses. Despite being given food, beds, air conditioning, and basic recreation these Raider scum decided to stage a prison break. It failed Hello, /r/DaystromInstitute. I'm not really sure how to begin this, so. who's up for a long preface qualifying what I'm about to post? Yeah, me neither, but I kinda feel like I ought to, yeah?

My friends had joked about it - even egged each other on to try it. We all laughed at the concept. Fucking a bowl of cheerios? The mere idea sent shivers down my spine. The initial roughness in texture. The cold milk shrinking my erect penis. "What joy could there be in that?" I thought to myself. After a few weeks nobody brought. The attack was violent and completely unexpected. For hundreds of years, humanity generally believed it was alone in the universe, but humanity was wrong. Witnesses - or at least those who witnessed something from many miles distant - say the horizon burned like a morning sun rising and that the sky was ripped open by lightning bolts spanning a thousand miles. Major population centers were destroyed. Johannesburg, Cairo, Osaka, Sao Paulo, San Francisco, Mexico City, Karachi, Chicago, Saint. Dear Bethesda, I believe in Energy weapons. Energy weapons have made my fortune and I wear Power Armor in a true Brotherhood fashion. As Veronica once said, "Energy weapons and Power Armor are usually top of our list, although I prefer anything vintage." Well now I prefer vintage swords in Fallout 76 due to the massive dmg blitz on energy weapons making them almost useless.

I've never enjoyed walking down the long halls, the worst part about them is since they go around the cylindrical frame of the ship you never see the end of them. The only points of reference are the corridors to the right and the windows to the left. "Hey Eric, you said 6 minutes right? Why does it feel like we've been walking 30?" "It's only been 2 minutes" "Says the man who made us work 4 hours overtime ya unperceptive jerk" "You made yourself work 2 hours overtime Hi everyone! Earlier this week, there was a conversation about the post-Jakku galaxy on a discord server I'm apart of. This really got my brain going as people argued about what happened to the Empire. I decided to write out a large blog post explaining the post-Jakku Empire and it's remnants to try and educate the SW fans who don't know much about the era. Enjoy! #Galactic Concordance With their crushing defeat on Jakku, the mighty Empire had finally fallen. Escaping from the captivity The only big man we have who can consistently hit a 16 footer is Joel Embiid. Who doesn't really shoot the mid-range shot anymore.

TL;DR Climate skeptic Jordan Peterson claims he "worked for" the UN on climate change and from this learned that there are no solutions for it, but actually just advised a CEO who actually did work for a panel on sustainability and Peterson's credit proving this is on a report full of recommendations to address climate change. I think it's pretty established now that if Peterson's not an active shill for climate "skeptics" or the fossil fuel industry, he's missing out on an income stream “…and a shipment of weapons on its way from Umbara was intercepted by Republic Patrols in the Cadavine Sector, luckily however the smuggler in question was able to dump his cargo and wipe his records before anything could be found in connection with Reformation activities on Umbara. And that’s the end of the report, sirs.” The aide-de-camp returned to his seat and Lesh blinked the fatigue out of his eyes as discreetly as he could.
